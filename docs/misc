Understood, but we can’t ship the badge out until we receive the start date.  You may want to reach out to your project manager and see who’s the ALT COR and have them send the start date because the COR is on vacation.

I started on Wednesday, July 12th working with the HAL group under the EXAMS division.
My COR is Nassar Salahaddin.
I think he’s on vacation currently.
 
Do I need to do something else to get the card sent to Hadley MA?
 
Thanks

I received notification that my USAccess credential is ready for pick and activation at SEC’s main office in Washington DC.
I am a contract programmer working remotely from Western Massachusetts.
 
I made an appointment with the nearest credentialing site in Hadley MA (where I initially went to get fingerprinting).
Can I have the card sent there so that I can activate it?
Thanks
